            <h1>Stage 5: My life long goals
            </h1>
            <h2>One of my life long goal is to be able to retire at the age 
                of 50 and not have to worry about my life financially. I would
                also like to travel the world, go to every inch of the globe. But right now
                my some-what short term goal is to find an internship this summer
                as a freshmen. Wish me luck!
